Some things have changed since Build 8:

- ALL the profiles didn't copy correctly, because of a Resource Error, that has now been fixed

- HOPEFULLY the little error with the Private messages have been fixed (WHen you double clicked, ALL the messages were opened, and not just all from ONE user

- Help file is now complete, with links and everything

- Help can be called from the Help menu in NChat

- Script support has been removed (More of a hinderance than help)

- The Help Form has been removed, because the help file is here!! :)

- This changes file now exists! Wooooo!

- Some pictures added to the store, to give the illusion of coolness

- Testing bug removed (Caused NChat to not work AT ALL on some comps)

- Plus some more fixes, additions, removals, and other junk

- A SMALL amount of code optimization, and a LOT of picture optimizations!

- License file. Please read it, coz it tells you what you can and can't do with my code

- The port structure of NChat has been changed. Those damn admins have blocked access to any NChat below Alpha at my school, and I hope that fixes it, and some other problems.

- New REALLY cool splash screen included. Uses Pixel-by-Pixel rendering for transparent PNGs

- Modules 1, 2 and 3 have been sorted, and placed into more appropriately named modules

- A whole lot more of the code is commented, just so it's easier for others to understand

- Some comments added. More to come! Don't understand anything? E-Mail me!!

- Notch has been updated, and now supports con, dis and several other NChat commands

- Oh, by the way, the help file has been fixed, and slightly updated

- NChat now sits at ~860kb big! (BTW, the old NChats used to be between1.0 mb and 1.4 mb!!)

- You can now have unlimited Chat windows going. No longer restricted to 50 or 100

- There is an Autobot help file now. You can learn how to program Notch, and a sample file is included

- FINALLY! The file transfer system has had a MASSIVE overhaul and should now work

- A bug with the Whiteboard was fixed, which made all pictures look funny if hovered over

- Another bug (who would have guessed?!? :) ) was fixed involving user icons not being changed when selected through the options.

- Notch has been updated significantly, usinga new INI based system. This means more interactivity can be obtained! Woah...

- NChat is now 80% Windows ME and lower compliant! (See Readme for more info)

- MASSIVE PM Bug fixed, where about 1,000,000 PMs were loaded into one window.

- PM window now has scrollbars! :|

- Once again the room creation portion of NChat now works! I forgot that the sckRooms winsock had to be on the same port :@. Damn I'm stupid sometimes

- Significant work done on the File Transfer, and at one stage, actually started to transfer files! WOAH! BUt not it doesn't work again :(

- Notch (The NChat Room Robot) can now LEARN new words through interaction

- NChat is now Internet Compatible! The server source is included! WOOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOOOOO!

- Text highlighting has been removed, because could cause a security error in Windows ME, where texts were not highlighted (in essence, white highlighted text on white background)

- Nearly 99% of data-parsing errors relating to Result() have been fixed, because the SplitVB5 function DIDN'T add a critical extra delimiter to the end! Seemed to work alright before...
