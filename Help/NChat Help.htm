            a big box up the top for all your incoming messages, and a small box

          you will see a box with the tip of the day. You can get rid of it for 
          good by clicking the check box to the left, then clicking <strong>Close<br />
          <img src="images/Tip.JPG" width="419" height="159" /><br />
          </strong>With that box out of the way, you will see the main NChat screen, 
          which will look something like this:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Main.JPG" width="568" height="474" /><br />
          The big box is where all the messages will come in, while the smaller 
          box down the bottom is where you send messages from. The tall box to 
          the right is the list of users. Their name and their picture will appear 
          here, as well as the number of files they have shared. See <a href="#sharing">section 
          9</a> for more information</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just below that is the Private 
          Messages box. All private messages addressed to you will appear here. 
          To view them, double click them and they will appear in their respective

        style' action. It is expressed in the third person (ie. Said by an invisible 
        person) and is useful for acting out some things<br />
        (By the way, you can change the || Next to your name from the Main Menu, 
        in Options, and you can change the colours of the messages and actions 
        from the Profiles Menu under the main menu. More on this later)</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using NChat 
        is fairly simple, if you have used MSN Messenger or something similar 
        before. To send a message to EVERYONE in the room, click on the small 
        box at the bottom, and type &quot;Hello World!&quot;. When you are done, 
        click the Send Button to the right, or press Enter. Watch in amazement 
        as your message appears up the top, along with all the others. If no message(s) 
        appear, then see <a href="#troubleshooting">Section 12 - Troubleshooting</a></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To your right,

              person has their own username, and their own icon next to their 
              name. You can change your icon by going to:<strong> Main Menu</strong>, 
              <strong>Options</strong> <strong>(CTRL+O)</strong>, then picking 
              your icon from the drop-down box. If you find that someone else 
              has an Icon that you can't select, then you need to purchase some 
              more from the NChat Store (See <a href="#ncredits">section 5 - NCredits</a>)</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can 
              change your username in the same way. Just above the box to select 
              your icon, is your username. You can change it for free, but there 
              are limits to your username:</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) It 
              MUST be less than 25 characters (Including spaces)<br />
              2) It MUST NOT have [A] in it (Because Administrators have this)<br />
              3) It MUST NOT have (A) in it (Because it looks a lot like [A])</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keeping

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the bottom 
        right, is your Private Messages box. ALL Private messages you recieve, 
        will appear here, as a small envelope, which looks like this:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can view

      <p align="center"><img src="images/Options.JPG" width="410" height="361" /> 
      </p>
      <p align="center">The first page is self-explanatory. The two boxes next 
        to the preview button are what your messages will look like. For example, 
        if one is set to // and the other one set to \\, then your message will 
        look like this:</p>
      <p align="center">// Your Name \\ Hello World!!</p>
      <p align="center">Page two looks like this (And can be accessed by clicking 
        the &quot;General&quot; Tab above)</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Options2.JPG" width="410" height="361" /></p>
      <p align="center">Page #2 contains more NChat Features. You can block out 
        some bad language, by unchecking &quot;Allow Swearing?&quot;. Smileys 
        are small pictures that appear when you type certain words, such as :) 
        and :P etc. You can disable these by unchecking &quot;Allow Smileys?&quot;. 
        If you want to start NChat again with NO NCredits, NO bans, NO icons etc, 
        then click the &quot;Reset NChat&quot; Button. NChat will restart, and 
        run from scratch</p>
      <p align="center">Page 3 looks like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Options3.JPG" width="410" height="361" /></p>
      <p align="center">And allows you to enter your username and password, to 
        log-in as an administrator. Do not worry about this unless you know what 
        you are doing</p>
      <p align="center">The final page contains file sharing stuff and looks a 
        lot like this:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Options4.JPG" width="410" height="361" /></p>
      <p align="center">Using this page is quite easy. If you don't see the folders 
        above, then uncheck the box marked: &quot;Do not share any of my files 
        with everyone&quot;, and this will share all the files in the selected 
        folder. To change the shared folder, click the folders until you find 
        the one you want shared. In the box marked &quot;File types to share&quot;, 
        enter the type of file you want to share. Click the &quot;?&quot; to learn 
        more </p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NChat has it's 
        very own currency! Each time you send a message, you recieve 1 NCredit. 
        When you save up enough, you can head to the new NChat store and purchase 
        some items. The store looks like this:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Store.JPG" width="458" height="394" /></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The item names 
        provide a description, but further explanation can be found by clicking 
        an item, then clicking 'Item Information', and it's price will appear 
        next to the box. You can double click the item to purchase it, or click 
        'Purchase this item'. If any extra information is required, then it may

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The flood button 
        lets you fill in spots on your picture (Such as the brown shirt in the 
        picture above). TO use it, select your colour, then click in the spot 
        you wish to fill. If the picture fills in the wrong places, you need to 
        check your picture. It must be sealed off, or else it will spread. For

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The file sharing 
        system doesn't work as of yet. But here is the information on how to use 
        it:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have 
        ever used WinMX, then you will be familiar with the file sharing system. 
        You right click a username, click browse, then select a file to download. 
        It downloads. NChat works like this.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Browse.JPG" width="403" height="312" /></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All you need 
        to do is right-click a file, and click download. When the file is downloaded, 
        then it will tell you, and you can find the file in the NChat folder. 
        You can tell how many files they have shared by looking next to their 
        name: (All of them have got their sharing disabled)</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Users.JPG" width="129" height="272" /></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is how 
        to disable or change file sharing:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go to <strong>Main 
        Menu</strong>, then <strong>NChat Options</strong>, then Sharing. The 
        *.* is the file types you have shared. Click &quot;?&quot; to learn more. 
        You can pick a folder to share from the list box, and enable / disable 
        sharing by clicking the check box. When files are shared, the number next 
        to your name will change. This is how many files you have shared</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When file sharing 
        is fixed, then this section will be updated</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ignore window 
        lets you ignore Private Messages from certain people. You can ignore people 
        by right-clicking their name, and then clicking Ignore. You can remove 
        the ignore by clicking <strong>View</strong>, then <strong>Ignore List</strong>, 
        then right clicking the name you wish to remove, and click <strong>Delete 
        Ignore</strong>. It's that simple!</font></p>

        A: This can occur because of several reasons, including a faulty / damaged

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: This message 
        will be displayed if your NChat settings file has been tampered with. 
        If you try, then NChat will pick it up, and tell you. This can also happen 
        if NChat was interrupted while saving. Also, NChat settings files are 
        only valid for one computer with one username (Eg. Grayda's file can't 
        be copied over to Cheyenne's Computer because that is considered cheating)</font></p>

        Just e-mail your question to <a href="mailto:firestorm_visual@hotmail.com?subject=nchat%20question!">firestorm_visual@hotmail.com</a></font></p>
      <p align="center">Glossary of terms<a name="glossary" id="glossary"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><em>Administrator</em><br />
        This term is given to a person who has almost TOTAL control over the NChat 
        Chatrooms. They Administer the room, and can (hopefully) keep the peace 
        and keep the room in order</p>
      <p align="center"><em>Loopback</em><br />
        Loopback mode in NChat allows you to run NChat on one computer. This is 
        handy for me, because I can test the functions of NChat, with one computer. 
        For those interested, NChat normally operates on 255.255.255.255, but 
        in loopback, it runs at 127.0.0.1, limiting the number of computers it 
        sends stuff to, to one. People running NChat with 2 or more people shouldn't 
        worry, nor touch this setting</p>
      <p align="center"><em>NCredits<br />
        </em>Imagine if someone gave you 1 dollar for each time that you opened 
        your mouth. You would be a millionaire! NCredits work just like that. 
        Think of NCredits as Dollars, Pounds, Marks, Rupees or whatever currency 
        you use. For each message that you send, you get 1 NCredit</p>
      <p align="center"><em>Notch</em><br />
        Notch is short for NChat AutoBot Machine, and is NChat's own Bot. Think 
        of a bot as an answering machine. If you are not home, then your message 
        is played to everyone who rings. Notch can handle more than 1000 messages. 
        When you type something (Which is called a trigger, and is like a phone 
        number), the response is sent (Like the message on your answering machine). 
        For example, if the Trigger is &quot;Hello Notch&quot;, and the Response 
        is: &quot;Hello (Your Username)&quot;, then when anyone in the room types 
        &quot;Hello Notch&quot;, then &quot;Hello (Username)&quot; is sent as 
        an everyday message, such as || Notch || Hello Bob!</p>
      <p align="center"><em>Raw Data<br />
        </em>Everything that is sent from NChat (ie. All messages etc.) are sent 
        in Raw Data Form. Raw Data is a complex term for 'stuff sent from NChat'. 
        All messages, actions, private messages etc., are sent as raw data</p>
      <p align="center"><em>Welcome Message<br />
        </em>This is a pre-set message, set by either the administrator or the 
        creator of the room. When a new person connects to your room, that message 
        is sent either to them, or to the whole room for them to read. A typical 
        welcome message may look like this:<br />
        || Welcome Message || Welcome to (The Room Name Here), (Your Username 
        Here), enjoy your stay!!</p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this concludes 
        the lengthy NChat help file!! Have fun and remember: Solid Inc.: Represent</font></p>
