' This is the Notch Sample File. You can use it in your chat room, or
' you can modify it to suit your needs. You can even post your new
' Notch file at our web-site: http://www.solidinc.tk

' The Notch file is quite easy to understand. The first section [General]
' determines what Notch does when you start him up or shut him down.
' Welcome1, Welcome2 etc. lets him say a hello greeting to everyone
' in the room. Welcome can go as high as you need to.

' Shutdown is the opposite. This is his goodbye message

' The next sections, from Phrase1 to whatever, are Notch's Questions.
' When someone chats, the question gets passed here, under "Question".
' If the question matches the one asked, then a random answer is picked
' (ie. Answer 3, then Answer7, then Answer1) and broadcasted
' The answer is different each time. You can seperate questions by adding
' a || to the end of the question. A * lets notch pick up parts of sentences
' See the help file for more info
